For my green screen project i would like to do a stop motion animation using drawings. I have never done any stop motion work so, i think it can be a fun and interesting thing to do.
I would like to do something about space like aliens and UFO's. I think something funny and cool to make would be an alien abduction going on in the background behind me. I can be a 
time consuming process having to make the drawings and making many cuts in a video, but i think the outcome will be worth it.
