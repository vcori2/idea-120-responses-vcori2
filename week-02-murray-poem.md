##Murray Poem  
how far is too far?  
what was once a projection on a wall can now take you into a new reality  
now humans can't tell what's real from the internet  
was that video real? am i talking with a human or internet intelligence?  
how far is too far? is it until we have lost sense of reality and there's no going back?
