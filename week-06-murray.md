Yes, I do think Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful, but only to a certain extent because yes, virtual reality is now a thing
but it's not as popular as iphones or laptops and it may be because people mainly see virtual reality as something to do with video games. It is not seen as something that can be helpful
in a workplace or school. I think companies that are creating technology like Apple and Samsung are always looking to make the next big thing that will make lots of money, but the products
they don't always take off and replace things already being used due to the costs to buy, how helpful the product is, and various other reasons. Murray's prediction has more to do with how 
the viewers will interact with movie environments and the actors in 'The Mandolorian' are able to see and interact with the environment, but they can also see how it's being created 
by people who create virtual environments. The actors know that the reality is made up and is only for them to get into character and know how to move or act according to what they see.
For viewers, if they were able to see the movie as a virtual environment it could feel like a real reality to them if they don't think about how it was created or don't know 
that objects were added in by computers and there's a whole process behind it.
