Questions that came up for me after reading the chapters were: Do games necessarily need rules in order to be classified as games? In what ways are games similar to songs, films, or stories? And lastly is modifying a game already made fair to the creator?

Do games necessarily need rules in order to be classified as games? I would say that it depends but for the most part yes. It depends because there are endless possibilities to making games. Games can be made out of thin air like the floor is lava which i would play as a kid that made me think i was a genius coming up with it. I think people have different definitions of what is a game and what is not. People may say that sports like volleyball and soccer are not games and others would say they are. 

I know there are games like the sims and other life simulator games that I've come to notice don’t have any rules but they are still games because of the experience. In the sims I could make my own challenges or let the sims live their life while I just spectate. I can build houses with no roofs, I can make the sim live outside, I can do anything within the game since it comes with no rules. I like games with rules since I think they add to the experience and make them more fun. For example, I can make a rule to make a sim complete all of their life wishes. if i did not complete any wishes the game would not be as enjoyable. It would be boring just watching a sim live a normal life without anything new. 

Besides making things interesting, having rules in a game can help create order and prevent cheating or other chaos. Rules teach people to follow directions and allows for a fair shot at winning things in games. Most games have rules. Even if I were to play tag and say there are no rules I think subconsciously people would make rules to follow. It’s interesting to think about it because it shows how rules and laws are always in place and we follow them without ever thinking of them or reading them on a wall first. Overall, i would say games don’t need rules to be classified as a game but they do make the experience better.
