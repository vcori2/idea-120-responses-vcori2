Some methods outlined by O’neil and Chalabi that I am subject to when using tools and consuming media on the internet include being shown only one opinion on subjects because of algorithms working in favor of a certain thing. There are times when I see a post on social media about a politician and I may interact with it and see the comments. Later on, I will see even more posts about that politician and whether they are positive or not depends on the first post I saw and then I'll never see the other side of the story because the algorithm will not show anything else unless i search it first. This can make for biased opinions and misinformation being spreaded on social media. I think the algorithm can be useful but it should not be trusted with everything.  

  I do think the internet would be more useful without the methods of targeted ads and shaped interactions because people would learn to research the topics they're interested in. This is important because I think nowadays people are quick to believe social media. It is incredibly easy to fake things with deep fakes, false statistics, and people using big words to be persuading which a lot of the time works. A person doing actual research can debunk these scams and find trustworthy sources. This would help people form factual opinions and be more educated so they won’t be easily deceived or have arguments based on beliefs when the facts are right there. Targeted ads and shaped interactions I think take away a person's freedom to decide for themselves, they give no chances to look somewhere else that may be more beneficial and the internet would be better off without them.
