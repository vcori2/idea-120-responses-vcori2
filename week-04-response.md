An image that would be read differently if it were seen in another medium could be magazine covers. I think if magazine covers that have insane titles for 
politics or celebrities and other topics were to be something that could be listened to like a podcasts, people could see how biased or ridiculous some 
of the headings and titles are which can even be misleading. A lot of the time magazine covers are making people think in specific ways and don't give people the chance to think on their own with the 
correct information and maybe a podcast or an auditory medium would be helpful.
The three messages that magazine covers consist of are linguistic messages that are the text and titles,
the image and the symbols in it, and aesthetic or what it makes the viewer think of. For a magazine cover that is about politics they could have a title about former President Trump that being the linguistic message, 
an image of Trump pointing and yelling, and symbolism with colors of red. All of it together makes a viewer think something negatively about Trump or the magazine is intended for people who don't like Trump.
