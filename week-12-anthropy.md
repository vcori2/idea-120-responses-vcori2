Accessibility in gaming and coding can help improve games in various ways. To be honest before taking this class i was scared of the thought of coding and making things with it, but it’s not as intimidating as it is made to seem. I think a lot of people see websites, games, and other digital platforms as difficult to make when in fact the computer does most of the work. More accessibility for people can help people start their own games that they once thought were impossible to make. Through coding and other ‘game’ creation tools people can make helpful websites to promote their products or even just make a website with resources for people for all sorts of issues.
	   
    
    I think more people using ‘game’ creation tools and coding makes for endless possibilities. People won’t be as scared of new technology and would actually be interested in them instead of pushing them away. People can solve various issues around the world just by creating a website, a inspirational movie or game, an interactive story, the list goes on. Now that things can go viral, the chances of getting recognition are higher and people can spread the messages out about environmental issues, politics, medicine, and other subjects where there are problems going on with not a lot of attention from the media. Video games can be better and made easier with more people on board. Games can be about anything and i think there is always an audience for almost everything. If people realize that they can make games and someone will support them, then they can go on to making great games that have potential and even move up to making other sorts of technology.
