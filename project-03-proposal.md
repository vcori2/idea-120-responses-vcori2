For my non-linear narrative, I would like to create a horror story. I plan to have the story be about a creepy home invasion. I enjoy horror stories and I think it would be an 
interesting process making the choices and including descriptive sections to have the viewer get creeped out. I think the intruder in the story could be a clown, an alien-like figure, 
or a scary ghost like the grudge character. I may start the story off by having the player realize that they are home alone and then start an activity like playing video games or something like that. After that, the scary stuff begins and I think it can also be cool to have the story loop somehow so it's like this never-ending nightmare story.
