For my non-linear narrative, I would like to create a horror story. I plan to have the story be about a creepy home invasion. I enjoy horror stories and I think it would be an 
interesting process making the choices and including descriptive sections to have the viewer get creeped out. I think the intruder in the story could be a clown, an alien-like figure, 
or a scary ghost like the grudge character. I think it can also be cool to have the story loop somehow so it's like this never-ending nightmare story.
