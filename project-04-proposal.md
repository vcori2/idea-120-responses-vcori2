For my 4th project, I will be including my 3 previous projects on one page as the content of my portfolio. I would also like to add a project from one of my previous design classes. I plan to have 4 screenshots, one for each project, and put them in order with a caption. My portfolio will be organized in chronological order. I plan to add links so the viewer can be redirected to a website with the full project on it and a small description.
