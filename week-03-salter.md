Some contemporary tools that could be used to create art that would be considered a Gesamtkunstwerk could include headphones, which nowadays have the ability to make things sound like they are right next to you physically. The headphones combined with tools that create visual components like projectors and digital screens, moving chairs, and even the use of familiar smells can make for awesome works of art that make a viewer feel a part of it. All of these tools have to do with the five senses, since in art, the senses are used in different ways. For example, in dance there is movement, in cooking there is taste, in music there is hearing, and to create a total work of art, I think it's important to have a little bit of everything. I think Gesamtkunstwerk is really about getting the audience to connect more with the art.
  
  I am not sure if there is an example of this in the Rhizome anthology. I think a lot of the art in the Rhizome anthology has to do with websites or visual art. From what I've gathered about what a Gesamtkunstwerk is, itâ€™s the use of a lot of art, like music, dance, theater, etc., to create one grand work of art. Today, the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk can be seen a little in movie theaters that now create a new experience for people. They can make the seats move, create wind or rain, and use loud surround sound systems to make a person feel like they are really a part of the movie they are watching.
